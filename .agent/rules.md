# AI Agent Rules

1. **GitHub Issues & Branching Strategy**
   - Whenever working on a GitHub issue, ALWAYS create a feature branch from `main`.
   - Feature branches should follow the naming convention: `feature/issue-[number]-[description]`.
   - Work ONLY on the feature branch. Do not commit directly to `main`.
   - Once the task is complete, notify the user so they can review and merge.
